PDF Export – Summary of All Desired Features/Behaviors for GitProof

User customizes what sections to include in the PDF:

Identity (name, avatar, bio, GitHub URL)

Stack summary (top languages, frameworks, stack % breakdown)

Top projects (user can select specific repos to showcase)

For each project: title, summary, tags, optionally AI-generated résumé bullets

Visuals (commit heatmap, pie charts, graphs)

Keywords (optionally)

README quality or AI-suggested README preview (optional)

Live export preview (WYSIWYG):

Users see an accurate, up-to-date preview before downloading.

All layout/styling matches what will be exported.

PDF export captures only the current state of the preview (user curation applies)

Export is not limited to all public repos; user selects which to include (with sensible defaults)

PDF export triggers:

User opens export modal (PDF curation UI appears)

User customizes selection, toggles sections, and sets project count

User clicks “Export” to generate/download PDF

Export process:

Uses html2canvas + jsPDF (or equivalent) to render the previewed content as PDF, pixel-perfect

Images, icons, charts are rendered at high quality (2x scale, no blurry outputs)

PDF respects page boundaries, with proper content scaling and pagination if needed

PDF filename reflects the user’s GitHub handle or name

AI-integration:

If enabled, PDF includes AI-suggested résumé bullets for projects

Optionally, shows AI “developer type” summary at the top (e.g., “Python and HTML heavy in 2022, transitioned to React in 2024”)

Can recommend which projects to feature, with explanation/justification

README improvement feature:

If a repo’s README is too short, an icon/notice appears

User can one-click “generate AI README” and see a suggestion

Optionally, suggested README can be shown inline or added to the PDF

PDF can be downloaded or stored in cloud (Supabase S3 etc) for persistent user access

All export logic and config lives in dedicated export components (no business logic in Dashboard/page)

All features work on both desktop and mobile

Summary
The GitProof PDF export is a highly customizable, WYSIWYG feature allowing users to curate which profile sections and repositories appear in their exported résumé-ready PDF. It includes AI-driven recommendations, section toggling, preview, and best-practice rendering. All logic is encapsulated in modular export components, with a focus on high-fidelity output and flexible UX.
