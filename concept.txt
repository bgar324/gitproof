GitProof – Full Comprehensive Breakdown
❖ Overview
GitProof is a developer-facing analytics platform that transforms a GitHub account into a recruiter-ready report. It bridges the gap between real work and recognized credibility by auto-parsing public repositories, READMEs, commit histories, and stack usage to generate clear, structured, and exportable proof-of-work.

❖ Core Purpose
Developers build. Recruiters skim.
GitProof translates developer work into recruiter-readable, résumé-grade signal.

❖ User Value Proposition
Auth with GitHub

Select which repos to analyze

Parse project stack, role, commit rhythm, README quality

Auto-generate résumé bullets and recruiter-optimized report

Export as PDF or share public GitProof profile

❖ Primary Use Cases
Audience	Use Case
Job-seeking devs	Add GitProof PDF to résumé or LinkedIn
Bootcamp grads	Showcase portfolio with GPT-enhanced summaries
Recruiters	Quickly assess candidate capabilities
Portfolio builders	Link GitProof page as proof-of-skill

❖ Top-Level Features
1. GitHub Integration
GitHub OAuth (auth + access token)

Repo selection UI with omit toggle

Public profile scraping if user not authenticated

2. Parsing Engine
Repo metadata: stars, forks, last commit

README decoding and NLP parsing

Language usage analysis

Commit history trends (weekly, total)

3. Inferred Stack Breakdown
Language % (e.g. JS 45%, Python 30%)

Role classification: frontend, backend, fullstack, infra, ML, CLI

Dependency file parsing (package.json, requirements.txt)

4. README Analyzer
Structure quality: headers, sections, instructions

Word count, presence of setup info

GPT-enhanced résumé bullets (for top 3–5 repos)

README linter score (optional)

5. Report Generation
Visual dashboard (frontend view)

Exportable PDF:

Stack summary

Top 3–5 projects (title, bullets, stack tags)

README quality

Commit heatmap

Résumé-ready format

6. Public Profile
/gitproof/benjamin style page

Mobile-friendly summary view

Recruiter share mode (PDF + links only)

7. Refresh Logic + Caching
Refresh cooldown (24h or manual trigger)

Redis + Postgres store parsed data

Delta fetch on refresh (updated repos only)

❖ Tech Stack
Frontend
Next.js (App Router) – structure, routing, SSR

Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling

Framer Motion – animations and transitions

Recharts – visualizing commit patterns, stack breakdown

Zustand – lightweight state management

NextAuth.js – GitHub OAuth handling

Backend
FastAPI – async backend, typed routes

Celery – task queue for heavy GitHub parsing jobs

Redis – job broker + refresh throttling

PostgreSQL – persistent storage of users, repos, analytics

OpenAI API – résumé bullet generation from READMEs

PyGitHub – GitHub API wrapper

Docker – containerization of all services

Infrastructure
Vercel – frontend + Next.js hosting

Render / Railway – backend + Celery worker hosting

Supabase Storage / S3 – storing generated PDFs

Sentry – error monitoring

Plausible – privacy-first analytics

❖ User Flow
plaintext
Copy
Edit
1. User logs in with GitHub OAuth
2. Select repos (or default to all public)
3. Task enqueued to Celery → Redis queue
4. Celery fetches GitHub data, parses + scores
5. Data saved to DB
6. Frontend polls for task status
7. Final report rendered + PDF ready
8. Optional: public profile published
❖ Scaling Plan
Each user brings their own GitHub token → 5000 API calls/hour

Redis queue decouples parsing load

Celery workers scale horizontally

PDF rendering capped to top N repos to control cost/time

GPT usage optional or gated (premium feature or capped usage)

❖ Planned Features
Recruiter dashboard view (bulk scans)

Custom README templates (for users to improve output)

GitHub App upgrade (vs OAuth)

“GitProof Score” as public badge (e.g. LinkedIn embed)

Open-source CLI version for self-hosted GitProof reports

Skill graph across time (year-over-year stack evolution)

❖ Open Source Philosophy
Parsing engine + PDF layout open source (MIT)

Core GitHub fetch logic transparent

OpenAI résumé layer optional (non-critical path)

Encourage community-contributed bullet generators and report styles

Devs can self-host GitProof and generate local reports for free

❖ Tagline Options
"Proof of work, without the guesswork."
"Your GitHub, recruiter-ready."
"The résumé layer for developers."
"Turn your GitHub into signal."

GitProof is the missing translator between your work and your worth.
And every dev needs it.


chunk 3: ai Features
- ai interpretation on the type of developer they are based on common technologies used, as well as their level of experience through how old their github is. include skill evolution, so like. "Python and HTML heavy in 2022, transitioned to React in 2024"

- ai advise as to which to showcase for recruiters and the gitproof PDF

- based on readme length for each repo, toggle an icon that just says that your read me is too short, generate ai suggested read me? (first part isnt really ai, but the latter is)
